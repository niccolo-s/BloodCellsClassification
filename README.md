# Convolutional Neural Network for Blood Cells Classification
This project was developed as part of the evaluation for the _Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning_ course at Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2024-2025.
The programming language used is Python, specifically employing the TensorFlow/Keras library.
